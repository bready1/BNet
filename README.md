# BNet

This project is an algorithm for training neural networks using Bayesian Linear Regression, among other things. The algorithm and demonstrations for regression and classification are in [main.ipynb](main.ipynb) , plotting the results from the classification demonstration (MNIST) is in [plot_mnist_results.ipynb](plot_mnist_results.ipynb).

The algorithm is outlined in [this post](https://peterbarnett.org/2021/03/04/bnet_algorithm/). 
Results are found in [this post](https://peterbarnett.org/2021/03/05/bnet-results1/).
